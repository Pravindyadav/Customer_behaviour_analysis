## 📌 **Project Overview**

This project explores and analyzes customer shopping behaviour using real-world style transactional data.
The goal is to uncover insights about customer demographics, purchase patterns, product performance, and the impact of discounts, subscriptions, and shipping types on revenue.

Using **Python**, **MySQL**, and **Power BI**, the project performs:

* Data cleaning & preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* SQL-based analytical queries
* Interactive dashboard visualization

---

## 🛠 **Technologies Used**

* **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **MySQL** (for data storage & analytical queries)
* **Power BI** (interactive dashboards)
* **SQL Window Functions & Aggregations**


## 🔍 **Key Analyses Performed**

### ✔ **1. Customer Revenue Analysis**

* Total revenue by gender
* Revenue contribution by age groups
* Average spend across shipping types
* Subscriber vs non-subscriber spending patterns

### ✔ **2. Behavioural Insights**

* Identification of **New, Returning, and Loyal** customer segments
* Repeat buyer tendencies vs subscription likelihood
* Discount usage behaviour and its effect on spending

### ✔ **3. Product & Category Insights**

* Top 5 products with highest discount purchase percentage
* Most purchased products within each category
* Products with highest average review ratings

### ✔ **4. SQL Queries for Insights**

All analytical SQL queries are included in the file:
📄 **Customer_shopping_behaviour_sql_queries.sql** 

These include:

* Window functions
* Aggregations
* Subqueries
* CTE-based segmentation
* Ranking top products

## 📊 **Power BI Dashboard**

The interactive dashboard provides visual insights, including:

* Revenue by gender, age group, and subscription status
* Customer segmentation
* Product performance (top categories, discount behaviour)
* Geographical and demographic patterns (if present in dataset)
